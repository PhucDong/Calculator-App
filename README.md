# Calculator App
This project is created to test the understanding of students in applying the fundamentals of JavaScript.

## Requirement:
### UX/UI:

- Must style to specifications (customization encouraged).
- The site must be responsive.

### Functionality:
- Have at least the clear, =, + and - functions.

### Optional:
- Add the ability to chain operations (e.g. 1 + 2 + 3 - 4) and display the result after each operation (check the demo).
- Make the calculator work properly when you click any operator twice (or more). For example, you click 1 then +, then 2, then +, then + again.
- Soft reset the calculator when there's an error (e.g. NaN) so that we can use the calculator again by clicking any number without having to refresh the page.
- Make the DEL button work as expected.
- Remove leading zeros.
